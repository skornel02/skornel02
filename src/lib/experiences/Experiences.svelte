			<p>
				What started out as a fun project for our trip, turned into a very serious project. The main
				goal of this project is to provide a platform for game creators where they can create games
				from building blocks (low code/no code) and a client for players to play these games.
			</p>
			<p>
				My role in this project was mostly backend focused, but I also took responsibility in
				creating the frontend aspect of the software too. I am very proud of this software, and the
				team I work with. Furthermore, we are very proud of the recognition we got in the form of
				<a href="#parkmyst">competition first place</a>.

				At this company there was a need for a custom built shift scheduling system, and I got the
				chance to work on it. With no previous infrastructure it was my role to negotiate how the
				system should work, what kind of interface it should have and then delivering it.

				Everyone knows the hardships of a student. You must always be on point with homework and
				assignments. To ease this burden, we created a social platform where you can share this
				information with your classmates.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was my, and my project partners’, first large-scale project. For me this was an
				invaluable experience in leadership and software architecture. My role was primarily working
				on the backend of the project and negotiating how it will communicate with multiple clients.
