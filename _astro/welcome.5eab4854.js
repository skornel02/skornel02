# Welcome to my site!

To get the ball rolling with this site I am making a few placeholder content,
but with time I hope that actual useful content will be here.
Until then I hope you enjoy this void of mine.

## Goals

- To make this website awesome
- ~~Use cool tech~~ (Svelte got that covered)
- Make content

## Disclaimer

This post also functions as a test markdown file for most of the **formatting**[^guarantee].
