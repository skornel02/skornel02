`,i={title:"Hidden post",description:"This is a hidden post!",date:new Date(164871546e4),tags:["meta"],language:"en",hidden:!0},d={type:"content",filePath:"/home/runner/work/skornel02/skornel02/website/src/content/posts/hidden-post.md",rawData:`
title: Hidden post
description: This is a hidden post!

tags: [meta]
language: en
hidden: true`};export{d as _internal,s as body,e as collection,i as data,t as id,n as slug};
