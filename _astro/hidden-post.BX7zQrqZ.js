const e="hidden-post.md",t="posts",n="hidden-post",s=`
Currently I'm experimenting with creating hidden (viewable) posts.
`,o={title:"Hidden post",description:"This is a hidden post!",date:new Date(164871546e4),tags:["meta"],language:"en",hidden:!0},d={type:"content",filePath:"/home/runner/work/skornel02/skornel02/website/src/content/posts/hidden-post.md",rawData:void 0};export{d as _internal,s as body,t as collection,o as data,e as id,n as slug};
