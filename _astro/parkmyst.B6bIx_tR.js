What started out as a fun project for our trip, turned into a very serious project. The main goal of this project is to provide a platform for game creators where they can create games from building blocks (low code/no code) and a client for players to play these games.

My role in this project was mostly backend focused, but I also took responsibility in creating the frontend aspect of the software too. I am very proud of this software, and the team I work with. Furthermore, we are very proud of the recognition we got in the form of competition first place.
