Completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering at the University of Szeged, Faculty of Science and Informatics. The program provided a solid foundation in computer science principles, programming languages, and software development methodologies. My studies included a mix of programming languages, mathematical foundations, engineering principles and electronics, preparing me for a wide range of challenges. 

While pursuing my degree I completed the Software Engineering specialization, which focused on software development and algorithm design.

My Bachelor's thesis focused on the optimization of cloud computing resource distribution and application of genetic algorithms. I had the pleasure to work with the [DISSECT-CF-Fog simulator](https://github.com/sed-inf-u-szeged/DISSECT-CF-Fog/) developed by the [IoT Cloud Research Group](https://www.sed.inf.u-szeged.hu/iotcloud) of the University of Szeged.
