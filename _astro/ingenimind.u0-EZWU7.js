I am currently working at Ingenimind Zrt. as a software developer. I am working mainly in the .NET ecosystem with high throughput backend systems.

While at this position one of the main projects I have been working is a big data processing system. This system is responsible for interfacing with many different systems and processing millions of lines of data every day. I have been working on the processing part and also have worked intensively on the integration testing software for this system.

Also I had the chance to mainly work on a live Poker broadcast system. This system is primarily made for reporters and players to see the current state of the game. We have been using DotNet Core, SignalR and React for this project.`,o={name:"Ingenimind Zrt.",role:"Software Developer",duration:"2023 - present",order:5},s={type:"content",filePath:"/home/runner/work/skornel02/skornel02/website/src/content/experience/ingenimind.md",rawData:void 0};export{s as _internal,i as body,n as collection,o as data,e as id,t as slug};
