Everyone knows the hardships of a student. You must always be on point with homework and
assignments. To ease this burden, we created a social platform where you can share this
information with your classmates.

This was my, and my project partners’, first large-scale project. For me this was an
invaluable experience in leadership and software architecture. My role was primarily working
on the backend of the project and negotiating how it will communicate with multiple clients.
