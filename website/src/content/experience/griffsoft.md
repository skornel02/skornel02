When I started to study at the University of Szeged I entered the dual training program. This program allowed me to work at GriffSoft Zrt. as a dual intern. 

While at the company I worked at a variety of different projects but mainly worked in the DotNet Framework ecosystem. Also I had the fortune to work with the ELK stack and get to know machine learning supported searching technologies. My favourite project was an older system where I lead a frontend migrating from an old AngularJS based frontend to a more modern approach to development.
